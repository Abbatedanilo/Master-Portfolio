# Master-Portfolio
A clean, beautiful, responsive and 100% customizable portfolio template for Developers!

## Clone And Use :clipboard:
- The website is completely built on `react-js` framework of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed.
- Clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterPortfolio.git
  ```
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command :
  ```
    npm install
  ```
- Now, the project is ready to use.
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.


## Customize it to make your own portfolio :pencil2:
- In this project, there are basically Personal Information that you need to change to customize this to anyone else's portfolio: 
- You will find src/Name.js file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:
-
    ``` 
    const greeting = {
        title: "Your Name",
        logo_name: "Name",
        subTitle:
        "subTitle.",
    };
    const socialMedia = {
        facebook: "Your facebook link",
        twitter: "Your twitter link",
        instagram: "Your instagram link",
        github: "Your github link",
        gitlab: "Your gitlab link",
        devto: "Your devto link",
        mailto: "mailto:Your mail"
    }
    ```
## Deployment :rocket: 
- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
